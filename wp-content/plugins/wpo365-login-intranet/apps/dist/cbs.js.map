When onShouldVirtualize return false,\r\n * List will run in fast mode (not virtualized) to render all items without any measurements to improve page load time.

For example, resizing the list, or passing in new props,\r\n * or forcing an update change cause pages to shrink/grow. When these operations occur, we increment a measureVersion\r\n * number, which we associate with cached measurements and use to determine if a remeasure should occur.\r\n */\r\nexport class List extends BaseComponent<IListProps, IListState> implements IList {\r\n  public static defaultProps = {\r\n    startIndex: 0,\r\n    onRenderCell: (item: any, index: number, containsFocus: boolean) => <div>{(item && item.name) || ''}</div>,\r\n    renderedWindowsAhead: DEFAULT_RENDERED_WINDOWS_AHEAD,\r\n    renderedWindowsBehind: DEFAULT_RENDERED_WINDOWS_BEHIND\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  public refs: {\r\n    [key: string]: React.ReactInstance;\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  private _root = createRef<HTMLDivElement>();\r\n  private _surface = createRef<HTMLDivElement>();\r\n\r\n  private _estimatedPageHeight: number;\r\n  private _totalEstimates: number;\r\n  private _cachedPageHeights: {\r\n    [key: string]: {\r\n      height: number;\r\n      measureVersion: number;\r\n    };\r\n  };\r\n  private _focusedIndex: number;\r\n  private _scrollElement: HTMLElement;\r\n  private _hasCompletedFirstRender: boolean;\r\n\r\n  // surface rect relative to window\r\n  private _surfaceRect: IRectangle;\r\n\r\n  // The visible rect that we're required to render given the current list state.\r\n  private _requiredRect: IRectangle | null;\r\n\r\n  // The visible rect that we're allowed to keep rendered.
